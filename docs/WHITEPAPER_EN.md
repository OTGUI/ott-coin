## 1. Executive Summary

**$OTTOGI** is an emotional utility memecoin built on the Solana blockchain.

Ottogi (오뚜기, 不倒翁) — the tumbling doll that always gets back up. $OTTOGI is a project that cheers on everyone who gets knocked down but stands back up, whether in the crypto market or in life.

|------|---------|

## 2. Vision & Philosophy

### Why Ottogi?

The Ottogi (tumbling doll) has been a beloved symbol across Asian cultures for centuries. Japan's Daruma (達磨), Korea's Ottogi, China's Budaoweng (不倒翁) — they all carry the same message:

> **"It's okay to fall. Just get back up."**

The crypto market is a world of volatility. -50%, -90% drawdowns are routine, and many lose hope. $OTTOGI is the first project to provide **emotional value** in this space.

### What We Believe

- **Everyone deserves encouragement** — whether your portfolio is red or life is tough
- **Community is stronger than technology** — when people unite, anything is possible
- **Memes are culture** — memecoins are expressions of community culture, not mere speculation
- **Like Ottogi, rise again** 🎎

### Emotional Utility

$OTTOGI's utility isn't DeFi yields or governance votes. It's **a warm message arriving in your wallet when you need it most.** That is the value $OTTOGI provides.

## 3. Tokenomics

### Total Supply: 2,430,000,000,000 (2.43 Trillion)

The supply carries meaning:

- **8.1 billion** — current world population
- **× 100** — complete, whole — 100% encouragement
- **× 3** — "In life, opportunity comes three times" (Asian proverb)
- **= 2.43 trillion** — 300 chances for every person on Earth

Decimals: 6. **Fixed supply, no additional minting.**

### Distribution

| Allocation | Ratio | Amount | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Liquidity Pool (LP) | 85% | 2,065,500,000,000 | Pump.fun Bonding Curve → Raydium LP |
| Airdrop Pool | 5% | 121,500,000,000 | NFT minting gas fees + community events |
| Team | 5% | 121,500,000,000 | Development/Operations (6-month lockup) |
| Marketing | 3% | 72,900,000,000 | KOL, events, content |
| Community Reserve | 2% | 48,600,000,000 | DAO voting, future use |

### Pump.fun Bonding Curve Launch

$OTTOGI launches via **Pump.fun** as a fair launch.

Pump.fun uses a **Constant Product Bonding Curve**, starting at an extremely low price that automatically increases with each purchase.

- **Initial price:** ~$0.000000001
- **Graduation condition:** Market cap reaches ~$69,000 (~420 SOL)
- **No presale, no pre-mining** — equal conditions for all participants

### Raydium Auto-Listing

Upon Pump.fun graduation:

1. SOL from the bonding curve + remaining tokens automatically create a **Raydium CPMM pool**
2. **LP tokens immediately burned** → permanent liquidity lock
3. Free market price discovery begins

> LP token burn is the cornerstone of rug-pull prevention. Nobody can withdraw the liquidity.

## 4. NFT Airdrop System

The core utility of $OTTOGI: **Hold the token and receive cheer NFTs automatically.**

### 5-Grade System

| Grade | Icon | Supply | Probability | Content |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Common | ⚪ | Unlimited | 80% | Short cheer messages |
| Rare | 🔵 | Unlimited | 15% | Longer cheer messages |
| Epic | 🟣 | Unlimited | 4.5% | Decorated cheer cards |
| Legendary | 🟡 | **40 Limited** | 0.48% | AI artwork + famous quotes |
| Mythic | 🔴 | **3 Limited** | 0.02% | Ultimate AI artwork |

**Legendary (40 Limited):**
- 20 Eastern style: Traditional Korean Ottogi doll + Eastern quotes
- 20 Western style: Weeble/Daruma/punching bag + Western quotes
- Each with unique AI-generated art and quote combination

**Mythic (3 Limited):**
- "In life, opportunity comes three times" — only 3 exist
- Each has a completely different art style and message
- Grants project governance voting rights to the holder

### 5-Tier Airdrop Frequency

Airdrop frequency and grade bonuses scale with holdings.

| Tier | Holdings | Frequency | Grade Bonus |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 🌱 Seed | 10,000 – 99,999 | Weekly | ×1.0 |
| 🌿 Sprout | 100,000 – 999,999 | 2x/week | ×1.5 |
| 🌳 Tree | 1,000,000 – 99,999,999 | 3x/week | ×2.5 |
| 🏔 Mountain | 100,000,000 – 9,999,999,999 | 5x/week | ×4.0 |
| 🌍 Earth | 10,000,000,000+ | Daily | ×6.0 |

> **Minimum holding:** 10,000 $OTTOGI. A very low barrier while preventing spam.

### Grade Bonus Effect

Higher grade bonuses increase the probability of receiving rarer NFTs.

| Grade | Base Rate (🌱 Seed) | Max Rate (🌍 Earth, ×6) |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ⚪ Common | 80.0% | 44.0% |
| 🔵 Rare | 15.0% | 27.0% |
| 🟣 Epic | 4.5% | 21.0% |
| 🟡 Legendary | 0.48% | 7.2% |
| 🔴 Mythic | 0.02% | 0.8% |

### Automatic Airdrop Process

1. **Daily 20:00 KST** — Holder snapshot (balance scan)
2. **Daily 21:00 KST** — Automatic airdrop to eligible tiers
3. Grade determined by **weighted random** algorithm (bonuses for balance/duration)
4. NFTs minted as **Compressed NFTs (cNFT)** and sent directly to wallets
5. Legendary/Mythic replaced by lower grades when limited supply is exhausted

---

## 5. Technical Architecture

### Blockchain: Solana

$OTTOGI chose **Solana** for:

- **Fast transactions:** ~400ms confirmation
- **Low gas fees:** ~$0.00025/transaction
- **Vibrant memecoin ecosystem:** Pump.fun, Raydium, Jupiter
- **Compressed NFT support:** Optimized for mass airdrops

### Compressed NFT (cNFT) — Metaplex Bubblegum

The core technology enabling mass airdrops is **Compressed NFT (cNFT)**.

| Comparison | Regular NFT | Compressed NFT |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Mint cost | ~0.01 SOL | ~0.00001 SOL |
| 1M mints | ~10,000 SOL | ~10 SOL |
| Marketplace support | ✅ | ✅ (Tensor, Magic Eden) |

cNFT uses **Merkle Trees** to compress data and dramatically reduce on-chain storage costs.

- **Merkle Tree spec:** maxDepth 20 (capacity: 1,048,576 NFTs)
- **Creation cost:** ~1.5 SOL (one-time)
- **Daily 1,000 mints:** ~0.01 SOL/day

```

- **Holder Scanner:** Scans holders via Solana RPC `getTokenAccountsByMint`
- **Grade Determiner:** Weighted random algorithm for grade selection
- **Message Selector:** Picks from 500+ messages DB by grade
- **cNFT Mint & Transfer:** Mints via Metaplex Bubblegum SDK and transfers

### Gas Fee Optimization

1. **cNFT usage** — 1,000x savings vs regular NFTs
2. **Batch processing** — Up to 5 cNFTs per transaction
3. **Dynamic Priority Fees** — Auto-adjusted based on network congestion
4. **Multiple RPC endpoints** — Helius + QuickNode + Public RPC distribution

### Metadata Storage

- NFT metadata permanently stored on **Arweave**
- Images hosted on **Arweave** or **IPFS**
- Metaplex-standard compliant metadata structure

### Custom Smart Contracts

No custom Solana Programs required for Phase 1–2. All functionality is achievable with Metaplex SDK + off-chain scripts. On-chain governance (SPL Governance / Realms) will be evaluated from Phase 3 onward.
